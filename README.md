Report Conclusion
-------------------------------------

The submitted program runs correctly and has been rigorously tested using a variety of input simulations. The final program version is the result of iterative collaboration and teamwork during the project. This Github repository is a record of the contribution that each member made and the number of modifications that were performed in order to optimise the software. We have been conscious of the need to record assumptions, user documentation and annotate the program to simulate a real world software project. The project brief has been successfully interpreted, a solution has been implemented to meet the defined criteria and the project has been recorded in the submitted PDF report document.
