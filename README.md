ARI Programming Assignment - Airline Seating




Assumptions:
Sperated metric is how many times we split the group,
Aisles are irrelevant,
Rectangular seating plan - will only be two variables (rows and seat plan), 
Assign algorithm assumes that the existing seat bookings don't have spaces in between them in a given row.
Database file seat letter are ordered alphabetically - seat row is not important.

Questions:
Will there be names in the database before starting?

Errors/Unforseen outcomes:
Entering 9 as group size resulted in 3 rows of 4 for some reason
Database kept locking
Initial plan was to use array - might get to work with lists
